# PowerPulse: Household Energy Usage Forecast

🧠 Overview

PowerPulse is a machine learning project aimed at accurately forecasting household energy consumption using historical usage data. The primary goal is to support both consumers and energy providers in making data-driven decisions to optimize energy use and promote sustainability.

📌 Problem Statement

Energy management is vital for households and providers alike. This project builds a predictive model to:

Help households monitor and reduce energy consumption.

Enable energy providers to forecast demand and manage load distribution.

Detect anomalies, integrate with smart grids, and support conservation efforts.

🎯 Business Use Cases
